# Issue 16: Make author name in generated images configurable

- The author's name, which is currently hardcoded as "Jaring" in the `generate_image_from_text` function, should be configurable.
- This could be set via the `config.yaml` file, perhaps using the `site_name` or a new, specific field.
- The user also suggests the possibility of using a hostname like `https://jaring.ihfazh.com`.
