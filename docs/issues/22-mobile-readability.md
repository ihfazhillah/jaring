# Issue 22: Improve Mobile Readability

## Description

The content width on mobile devices is currently too wide, making it difficult to read. The line length should be optimized for a better reading experience on smaller screens.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The maximum width of the main content area should be constrained to a comfortable reading width (e.g., around 65-75 characters per line) on all screen sizes.
- On mobile devices, the content should have appropriate padding on the left and right to avoid touching the edges of the screen.
- The font size might need to be adjusted for mobile to ensure legibility.
- The changes should be implemented using CSS media queries to ensure they only apply to the relevant screen sizes.
