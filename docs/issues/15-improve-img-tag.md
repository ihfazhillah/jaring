# Issue 15: Improve !img{} tag text wrapping and layout

- Implement automatic text wrapping for the content inside `!img{}` tags. The text should wrap to a new line after approximately 30 characters.
- The author's name ("Jaring") should be centered at the bottom of the image.
- The font size of the author's name should not be increased.
- The overall image size should be made bigger.
